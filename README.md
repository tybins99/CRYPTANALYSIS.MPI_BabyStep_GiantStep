## __Project description__
This project aims to solve the El Gammal cryptanalysis problem using the shank algorithm
(aka Baby step / Giant step) using the parallel library called MPI that permits to use
a cluster of computers to cut and dispatch the problem into small pieces, and then to
aggregate the results coming from all the nodes of the cluster.


## __Compilation__
Compiled on Visual studio 2017 (both release & Debug)
